<h2>Brody Uehara</h2>

Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm a Data Engineer at kWh Analytics, an InsurTech startup based out of San Francisco, CA. Although I primarily work on the backend of large-scale data systems, I also enjoy working with frontend technologies like React & Next.js to craft beautiful user interfaces.

I was born and raised in Honolulu, HI and graduated from the University of Hawaii at Manoa in 2021 with my degree in Computer Science.
